# 🚦 TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation Using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a predictive system that estimates traffic volume based on historical data and influencing factors like weather, time, and holidays. It uses machine learning models to provide accurate traffic predictions that can aid in traffic control and city planning.

## 📌 About the Project

Traffic volume estimation is crucial for urban planning, reducing congestion, and enhancing road safety. In this project:

- We explore traffic data with time-based, weather-based, and seasonal features.
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are performed.
- A machine learning regression model is trained to predict hourly traffic volume.
- Model performance is evaluated using common regression metrics.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask (optional, if deployed as web app)
